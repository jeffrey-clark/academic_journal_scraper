      "Notes. Columns (1)–(5) cut the sample by the indicated minimum percentile of income using both homeowners and renters. Columns (6)–(9) cut the sample by homeownership status. The reason to allow for overlapping groups is that a policymaker is likely to care about the average effect among all high income households rather than a single percentile. Results for income above the 95th percentile can be seen in Table 3. Column (6) focuses on homeowners and column (7) focuses on renters above the 75th percentile. Column (8) focuses on homeowners and column (9) focuses on renters above the 90th percentile. The dependent variable is the average commute time per worker in a household, the variable R is one when the MSA has a reciprocity agreement in place, mtr is the marginal tax rate paid, and ▵atr is the average tax rate in the state of residence minus the counterfactual average tax rate. All specifications include MSA by year dummies, state by year dummies, occupation dummies, household and person controls, MSA by state controls, and policy controls. All standard errors are clustered at the MSA‐state level. ***99%, **95% and *90%.\n",
